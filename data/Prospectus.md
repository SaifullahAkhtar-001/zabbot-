# SHAHEED ZULFIKAR ALI BHUTTO

January 5, 1928 - April 4, 1979
Former Prime Minister of Pakistan

"We will give science and technology requirements the highest
priority and our attention. To implement any program of scientific
and technological development, the country needs to train scientific
manpower. In this, the schools, colleges and universities have to
play their role. I desire that vast number of people of Pakistan
should acquire technological skills. I want first-class science in
Pakistan because nothing less is acceptable. And I wish Pakistan to
be increasingly self-reliant in all aspects of technology."

Former Prime Minister of Pakistan,
Founding Chancellor SZABIST University

"Technology and Communication have changed our world and are
influencing a global culture. The ability to google information from
anywhere in the world puts technology into the hands of even the
most isolated rural communities in the developing world. The more
people learn, the more they want to learn. The more they interact,
the less likely they will be to fear the unknown. Just as democracy
and educational exchange promote peace, the free flow of modern
technology and communication promote peace."

### Why Study Cyber security?

The world is adapting innovative IT solutions such as mobile technology, online banking and electronic government services into everyday use. However, with so many e-solutions and such extensive use of the Internet, attention needs to be turned to the security issue. Cyber systems require innovative and secure IT solutions for everyday use. Therefore, the demand for skilled security professionals is arising to protect against cyber-attacks. Offered through the Department of Computer Science, MS (Cyber security) is designed to respond to the fast-growing demand for technical cyber security experts nationally and internationally. It provides the necessary foundations for the design and development of systems that need to be secure. The major focus will be given to the design of secure systems that exhibit confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The program will provide students with core skills in wide aspects of the security of information systems.

Key objectives of the program are as follow:

PEO-1 Recognize and evaluate security requirements and issues in organizations using IT systems.

PEO-2 Assess cyber security risk management policies to protect an organization's critical information and assets adequately.

PEO-3 Measure the performance of security systems within an enterprise-level information system to maintain and update an enterprise-level information security system.

PEO-4 Implement continuous network monitoring and provide real-time security solutions.
