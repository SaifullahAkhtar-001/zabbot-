Why study Cyber security?

The world is adapting innovative IT solutions such as mobile technology, online banking and electronic government services into everyday use. However, with so many e-solutions and such extensive use of the Internet, attention needs to be turned to the security issue. Cyber systems require innovative and secure IT solutions for everyday use. Therefore, the demand for skilled security professionals is arising to protect against cyber-attacks. Offered through the Department of Computer Science, MS (Cyber security) is designed to respond to the fast-growing demand for technical cyber security experts nationally and internationally. It provides the necessary foundations for the design and development of systems that need to be secure. The major focus will be given to the design of secure systems that exhibit confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The program will provide students with core skills in wide aspects of the security of information systems. Program Objectives The cyber security program is planned to satisfy the increasing security intensive needs of private and public sector organizations. In this program, students will equip with the various skills and techniques which are important for securing IT networks and systems. Students having a strong background in Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering or equivalent are the potential candidates for the Master of Science Cyber Security program. Upon successful completion of the degree program, students will be able to use the latest tools and techniques of cyber security. After graduating from this program, students may have a potential career in various disciplines such as the telecommunications sector, software industry, intelligence agencies, e-businesses, e-government, banking, financial technologies, health care, and insurance. The goal of the program is to enable students to apply scientific and technological development in building a secure information society. The aim is to make technology-driven solutions to secure cyberspace. Moreover, to allow students to have hands-on digital forensics experience, this deals with the investigation and recovery of information found in digital devices to identify computer-based crime. The area is becoming critical for both data security and law enforcement. MS in Cyber Security offers strong expertise for a career in securing and managing the cyber society.

Key objectives of the proposed program are as follow:

• Recognize and evaluate security requirements and issues in organizations using IT systems. • Assess cyber security risk management policies to protect an organization’s critical information and assets adequately. • Measure the performance of security systems within an enterprise-level information system to maintain and update an enterprise-level information security system. • Implement continuous network monitoring and provide real-time security solutions.
